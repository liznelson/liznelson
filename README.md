### 🧑‍💼 Some facts about me:
- I'm work at Ingeniux. I help define and implement technical solutions to meet the needs of our customers. I work in the intersection of business, software and UX. 
- I'm currently in two degree programs at the University of London. 
  - BSc in Data Science and Business Analytics at the London School of Economics
  - BSc in Computer Science at Goldsmiths with a specialism in Machine Learning
  - Seems like overkill? Why not get a Masters instead? AMA. 
    - They are really distinct programs. 
    - Imo, master's in cs and datascience that don't require prerequistes in maths and cs aren't worth my time or money. My background's not in STEM so I would rather start at the undergraduate level and take a more challenging masters.
- My background is in Art and Design. I worked in exhibition coordination and fine art logistics before I transitioned to tech.
  - I've travelled internationally with Picassos, installed huge [Louise Bourgeois Spiders](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/louise-bourgeois-spiders/index.html) and worked on projects at nearly every museum in New York City. Art is fragile, expensive and often absurd. The art world is full of billionaires, visionaries and weirdos. I have a ridiculous amount of stories. AMA.
  - I'm handy in a fabrication shop. I love making things.
